# Governance Recommendations (Radford-Style, Signals-First)

This document provides governance patterns that scale: clear decision rights, auditable exceptions, and a repeatable operating cadence.

---

## 1) Guiding principles

1) **Job content ≠ person performance**  
   - Levels and ranges describe the job, not the individual’s output.

2) **Governance beats heroics**  
   - The goal is fewer exceptions, not better exception handling.

3) **Explainability (pay transparency readiness)**  
   - A manager should be able to explain a pay decision in 60 seconds.

4) **One system**  
   - Avoid “shadow leveling” or “special ranges” without explicit policy.

---

## 2) Decision rights (RACI)

### Decisions that must be governed centrally
- Level definitions and rubric changes
- Job family taxonomy and track definitions (IC vs Manager)
- Range architecture changes (midpoint progression, band overlap)
- Offer exceptions (> midpoint and > max)
- Off-cycle promotions tied to compensation changes

### Recommended RACI (default)
- **Accountable**: Total Rewards (or Comp)
- **Responsible**: TR + HRBPs (execution), Recruiting Ops (offers)
- **Consulted**: Finance, Functional leaders, Legal (if transparency mandates)
- **Informed**: Managers (via enablement)

---

## 3) Offer governance (the fastest stabilizer)

### Offer targets (example policy — tune per company)
- Default offer target: **90–105% of midpoint**
- Above midpoint (105–115%): allowed only with justification
- Above max: requires special approval + exception log entry

### Exception criteria (allowed reasons)
- Verified scarce skill / critical role
- Geo constraints / onsite requirement
- Internal equity constraints documented
- Competitive counteroffer evidence (where policy allows)

### What must be documented for exceptions
- Role, level, family, location
- Offer as % midpoint and % max
- Reason code + justification paragraph
- Approver name + date
- Planned follow-up action (e.g., range review, role re-level review)

---

## 4) Promotion governance (prevent level drift)

### Promotion guardrails
Promotion requires **role evidence**, not only performance:
- Scope/impact expanded and sustained
- Autonomy increased
- Complexity and ambiguity increased
- Influence expanded (cross-functional, strategic)
- (Manager track) people leadership scope increased

### Promotion packet (minimum)
- Current role summary vs proposed role summary
- Evidence mapped to rubric dimensions
- Calibration notes (who reviewed)
- Compensation impact alignment with range rules

### Anti-patterns to block
- “Promotion to retain” without role change evidence
- “Promotion because cycle” without rubric evidence
- “Title-only promotions” to satisfy expectations

---

## 5) Range governance (make ranges usable again)

### Refresh cadence
- Default: **annual** refresh
- Fast-moving markets: **semi-annual** refresh for high-volatility families
- Trigger-based refresh: if ceiling pressure exceeds threshold

### Band design rules (common guardrails)
- Midpoint progression should be consistent and explainable
- Overlap should reflect internal mobility reality
- “Max” should not routinely be exceeded without explicit policy (or max isn’t real)

### Temporary mitigations (use carefully)
- Targeted premiums (skill-based) with expiration and review
- One-time adjustments for compression
- Geographic differentials rules (documented)

---

## 6) Job architecture governance (taxonomy + levels + titles)

### Taxonomy
- Define: job family → sub-family → track → level → title
- Avoid mixing IC and Manager responsibilities in one ladder

### Level rubric
Use consistent dimensions:
- Scope/impact
- Complexity
- Autonomy
- Knowledge depth/breadth
- Influence
- People leadership (manager track)

### Title architecture rules (example)
- Allowed titles per level (and disallowed “inflation” titles)
- Consistent naming conventions across families
- “Principal/Staff” titles require rubric proof and calibration

---

## 7) Operating rhythm (how governance stays alive)

### Quarterly “Architecture Health Review”
Inputs:
- Red Flag Dashboard trends (ceiling/midpoint/drift)
- Exception log summaries
- Promotion distribution by level and family
- Hiring acceptance/decline signals (if available)

Outputs:
- Decision log updates (what changed and why)
- Backlog for structural changes
- Manager enablement updates

### Decision logs (non-negotiable)
Maintain:
- Range changes log
- Level/rubric changes log
- Exceptions log (offers, off-cycle)
- Title exceptions log (if allowed)

---

## 8) Manager enablement (the real scaling lever)

Deliverables:
- 1-pager: “How levels work here”
- 1-pager: “How pay ranges work here”
- “How to make an offer” rubric cheat sheet
- “Promotion packet template”

Goal:
- Managers can explain decisions with consistency and confidence.
