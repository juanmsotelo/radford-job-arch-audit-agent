# Overview

This project documents a repeatable way to run **Job Architecture Audits** using internal signals.

Primary use cases:
- Your ranges are breaking (offers above max, incumbents above max)
- Promotions feel inconsistent (“level drift”)
- Titles are inflated or inconsistent
- You want governance: defensible, auditable decision rules

Outputs are designed to be:
- Board/exec friendly (clear risks + plan)
- HR/Finance operable (governance + next data request list)
- Agent-ready (structured output schema)
